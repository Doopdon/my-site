                  <p>I am a Denver-based developer with an emerged passion in front end development.</p>
                  <p>I graduated from Kansas State University in 2016. I started my career working in integration; it was there I learned how to work with web technologies mostly web APIs and web sockets. My skills with web technologies grew when I worked with Richmond American Homes, there I learned how to work with front end technologies like Jquery and Bootstrap and worked extensively with javascript, working for SSP I learned angular, and typescript.</p>
                  <p>At SSP innovations I worked mainly on backend projects. However, I also gained experience working as a front end developer and found that is where I was most passionate.</p>
                  <p>After SSP I worked with several individuals to make websites in my free time. I find this type of work gave me much more freedom to learn new technologies. So far I have learned React, SCSS, and Vue, as well as learning how to design websites from the ground up.</p>
                  <p>I have a sufficient understanding of the following:</p>
