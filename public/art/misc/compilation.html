        <h1>Here are some miscellaneous pieces I did.</h1>
        <div class='container'>
            <div class='description'>I had this idea for a christmas themed page with snow flakes and tags hanging down</div>
            <div class='description'>Things I learned: I leaned a little bit about 3d styles (that rabbit hole went deep) I also started using javascript to generate elements. I also learned my Macbook Air hates hundreds of snow flakes animated in chrome and will start to get very hot. to help I only give the bigger ones the snowflake svg, the tiny ones are just circles. I also started to learn about parallax, The snowflakes fall at different rates depending on their apparent distance, which lead to a redo of my main website. </div>

                <iframe src="/art/misc/snow/snow.html" width="100%" height="100%"></iframe>
            </div>
            <div class='description'>I wanted to recreate some Neon lights I saw <a href='https://freefrontend.com/css-glow-text-effects/'>Here</a>. I think I got them looking pretty slick, but the "neon light" font costs money so I can't use that. I think it's time to learn how to make fonts. </div>
            <div class='description'>Things I learned: I learned how inline-block works which was long overdue. I also learned that I need a white font with a colored shadow to give the best glowing effect. I also learned I can have multiple shadows. These have a white and colored shadow.</div>
