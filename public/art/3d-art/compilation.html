            <div class='description'>I wanted to do something more complicated than simply moving divs around in 2 dimensions. I got the idea for this scene from a door opening in my home. The hardest part was not the door swinging it was the text that switches from white to black as the door passes. If you look close enough you can see it didn't quite work 100%.</div>

            <div class='description'>I used a text shadow around the text this time. Interesting enough there are 4 text shadows with no blur 1 px to the top/right/bottom/left which i found gave the best outline. This made the complex transition from above unnecessary, but I don't like it as much.</div>

            <div class="description">I found this animation online <a href="https://codepen.io/jeffpowrs/pen/mCbhq/">Here</a>. But for some reason its broken but I remember messing with it years ago. I found it in my bookmarks and fixed it. This is what it was supposed to look like.</div>

            <div class='description'>I remember messing with it a few years ago, but could not make sense of it so I put it aside. But upon re-visiting it I deconstructed the randomness and built a cube with it. I hope to turn this into a functional rubix cube some day.</div>

            <div class="description">I decided I wanted to make my poor computer cry so I made this galaxy. It's made out of 13 concentric rings that rotate slower as they get bigger. Each ring consist of 36 stars with a radom 3d offset for each star. This in no way simulates a real galaxy. I might revisit it any try to get the spiral effect to work.</div>

            <div class='description'>I remember seeing an amazing spinning mirrored disco ball made in css and had no idea how it could be done. (I have unfortunately lost the link). I think it was done by simply shifting an image behind it as it turned but I don't know if my attempt is very convincing. I think the problem is that the image is skewing inside the mirror. a real mirror would not do that.</div>
